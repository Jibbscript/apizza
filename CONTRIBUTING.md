# Contributing to apizza

So I have very little experience contributing of running open source projects so just like make a pull request or whatever... if you want to.

I'll keep it pretty chill, but just make sure you follow theses guidlines:
- Test your code before you commit it
- Run `gofmt` to format the code
- Work off of the dev branch
